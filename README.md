# Skyle IK App

This is the official Skyle IK App for the Skyle Integration Kit by eyeV GmbH.

The Skyle Integration Kit is a remote eye-tracker which is available here: [https://eyev.de/sik](https://eyev.de/sik).

With Skyle IK you can create products which support eye-tracking. Skyle IK is specifically designed to be integrated with any programming language with the open sourced [gRPC protos](https://github.com/eyev-de/Skyle.proto).

The Skyle IK is written in flutter and is supported on any operating system. So is the [dart_skyle_api](https://github.com/eyev-de/dart_skyle_api) which is the official dart sdk for Skyle IK. We also offer a [C# .net sdk here](https://github.com/eyev-de/SkyleAPI.NET) and a [Swift sdk](https://github.com/eyev-de/skyle-swift-sdk).
